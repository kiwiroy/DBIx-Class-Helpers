=head1 DESCRIPTION

These functions will slowly become the core implementations of many existing
components.  The reason for this is that often you are not able to or unwilling
to add a component to an object, as adding the component fundamentally changes
the object.  If instead you merely act on the object with a subroutine you are
not committing as seriously.

=head1 EXPORTS

=head2 correlate

 correlate($author_rs, 'books')

This function allows you to correlate a resultset with one of it's
relationships.  It takes the ResultSet and relationship name as arguments.  See
L<DBIx::Class::Helper::ResultSet::CorrelateRelationship/SYNOPSIS> for an in
depth example.
